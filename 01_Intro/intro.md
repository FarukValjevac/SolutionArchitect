1. Every service in AWS is promoted with "high available", therefore I will not repeat it as a strength in every service. Is a service not high available I will mention it. ðŸ˜…
2. Remember, it is not a deep-dive into each AWS service, it is a summary to understand differences between services, to create an overview in your brain.
3. If anything is wrong and you are really sure, feel free to create an Github issue or join the Element group to discuss it.
4. If somebody wants to improve it, feel free to create an branch, work on it and create an Pull-Request.
