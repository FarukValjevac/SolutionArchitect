<br>

## S3
The core service of AWS, a key/value store for objects.

### S3 Types
- S3 Standard: General-purpose storage for various data types like static websites, videos, pictures, and more.
- S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access): Cost-effective storage for infrequently accessed data, suitable for backups and disaster recovery.
- S3 One Zone-IA (Infrequent Access): Cost-effective infrequent access storage with data stored in a single availability zone for reduced redundancy.
- S3 Glacier (Instant Retrieval): Low-cost archival storage with quick retrieval times for data that may be needed more frequently.
- S3 Glacier Deep Archive: Extremely low-cost archival storage with longer retrieval times, suitable for data that is accessed very infrequently. Also called cold data.
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering: Automatically moves objects between frequent and infrequent access tiers based on changing usage patterns, optimizing costs.

### Pro
- Different tiers for data backups.
- Cheap data store of any kind of data.
- Able to trigger Lambda functions.
- Accessible by Lambda.
- Versioning of data in S3 possible.
- Ability to create different path, for example /photos, /private, /secure and grant specific or different policies to each path.
- Lifecycle rules: Manage things on S3 for example move data from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier or delete data which are older than 7 years. 
- Sync between S3 buckets in different regions possible via CLI.
- Batch operations: Encrypt un-encrypt objects etc.
- Event Notifications: Send events via EventBridge to over 18 AWS services like SNS, SQS, Lambda.
- S3 is accessible via roles, can also have policies and you can create an secret link to grant access via this links to other AWS users.
- Requester pays model. You can configure that the requester pay the network costs.
- Possible to set MFA to delete something in S3.
- Ability to set data encryption.
- S3 Glacier Vault Lock. A vaulted object can no longer be deleted.
- Possibility to create pre-signed URL¬¥s. Send other users or friends the link, then he has temporary access over the link (download something for example GET).

### Use Cases
- Deploy static websites, also possible to deploy React, Vuejs websites which have access to an API server.
- Use S3 as a backup database.
- Personal use to store pictures, videos or private backups.
- AWS using S3 for backup for other services like EBS snapshot, Aurora backups, DynamoDB backups, EFS backups etc.

___
<br>

## ElastiCache
ElastiCache is a database in RAM for high performance read.<br>
Redis- and Memcached-compatible service.

### Pro
- For frequently accessed data.
- Session management, store user session data.
- Attachable to multiple microservices.
- Speeds up database and application performance while caching database data etc.
- Compatible with RDS and Aurora.
- Redis for scaling, durability, automated backups to S3. You can also make a backup to the SSD.
- Memcached for multi-node partitioning, multi-threaded architecture.

### Contra
- No backup method for Memcached, but you can use Redis, just keep in mind.

### Use Cases
- In memory caching.
- Speeds up database and application performance.
- Data Analytics.
