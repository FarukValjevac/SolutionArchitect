# Convenient Things

## CloudFormation
AWS CloudFormation enables you to create and provision AWS infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly. It helps you leverage AWS products such as Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon SNS, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling to build highly reliable, highly scalable, cost-effective applications in the cloud without worrying about creating and configuring the underlying AWS infrastructure. AWS CloudFormation enables you to use a template file to create and delete a collection of resources together as a single unit (a stack).

### Pro
- No resources are manually created what is good to prevent mistakes.
- Changes are reviewed.
- Easily estimate costs using CloudFormation template.
- Saving strategy: Automate to hibernate EC2 for example over night and restart automatically in the morning etc.
- Ability to destroy and re-create infrastructure on the cloud on the fly.
- CloudFormation starts all services in a ordered way.
- CloudFormation automatically creates a diagram of your infrastructure, you can see all services and their relations.
- Easy to replicate your entire infrastructure to other accounts for example when you have an dev and prod account you can easily replicate it with CloudFormation yaml file. Take the yaml file and replicate it everywhere.
- Multi region deployment possible.
- You can always do updates. CloudFormation will give you an overview about the changes and updates everything include the diagram documentation.


CloudFormation will give you a diagram like this.

## Solution Architect Summary üòç

- <b>CloudFormation: </b>Use AWS CloudFormation to provision and manage infrastructure as code, ensuring consistent and repeatable deployments of resources and applications. CloudFormation creates all resources for you with the aid of an from you created or from AWS pre-created yaml file, its reliable and cost effective. Fully managed services like Beanstalk also using CloudFormation in the background. Never create AWS services manually, do it with CloudFormation.

- <b>API Gateway: </b>Use API Gateway to secure and managing you APIs for example in front of Lambda functions.
