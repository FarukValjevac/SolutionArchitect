## Athena
Serverless query service to analyze data stored in S3.

### Pro
- Use larger files, Athena is best practice for that to minimize overhead > 128mb
- Athena Federated Query allows you to run SQL queries across relational and npn-relational databases.
- Do columnar data scanning to save costs, analyze only the columns what do you need to analyze.
- Recommended formats for performance is Parquet or ORC. Use AWS Glue to convert data to Parquet or ORC.
